               <h2>Making Breakfast</h2>
               <p>Spending time and preparing breakfast for your children is very rewarding. Not only do you know what they are putting into their bodies, but you can also use the most important ingredient...LOVE!</p>

               <h2>Personal Golf Lessons</h2>
               <p>Golf is such a cerebral sport that can truly impact the development in task orientation amongst children. Once they put all of the steps together and finally get a successful swing, its a joy for everyone involved.</p>

               <h2>Movie Time</h2>
               <p>Going to the movies with your children is an experience. The entire process from getting the movie ticket to getting the popcorn are all tools to build a lasting memory, NOT to mention the actual film. I love for us to speak on our likes and dislikes from the movie on the ride home. I enjoy hearing their thought process on something we had a mutual first time experience with.</p>

               <h2>Video Games</h2>
               <p>Playing video games is the ultimate activity to bridge the gap with your children. You can teach them things you did for fun growing up, all while they can teach you new things on the new consoles that they know.</p>

               <h2>Traveling</h2>
               <p>Traveling and seeing the world with your children is essential with building a bond with your family. When they can read books, watch tv and movies and recognize places and say "We've been there daddy", is a pretty cool feeling. </p>
